## Rust Projects built with Rust by asking DeepSeek AI

I asked **chat.deepseek.com** for several project ideas that I could build using the Rust programming language to get more experienced with the syntax and libraries (crates) of the language.

The challenge I gave myself is to complete as many, if not attempt all, of these projects from the initial prompt I gave. I will try to not use the AI for programming help for the projects as I'm not really dependent on using AI anyways.

Below is the prompt I gave and recieved from the chat AI with difficulties ranging from:

1.  ##### [Beginner](#beginner)
2.  ##### [Intermediate](#intermediate)
3.  ##### [Advanced](#advanced)

##### My prompt:

> `I want to use the Rust programming language to create some projects to get experienced with it. I am looking for some beginner, intermediate and advanced projects to build using Rust. Can you think up some ideas I could start doing?`

##### DS response:

Absolutely! Rust is a fantastic language to learn, and building projects is a great way to gain experience. Below are some project ideas categorized by difficulty level:

### Beginner Projects

_These projects will help you get familiar with Rust's syntax, ownership model, and basic libraries._

##### Command-Line Calculator

Build a simple calculator that takes input from the command line (e.g., calc 2 + 2) and outputs the result.

-   Learn: Basic I/O, parsing, arithmetic operations.

##### To-Do List CLI

Create a command-line to-do list manager where users can add, remove, and view tasks.

-   Learn: File I/O, vectors, and basic error handling.

##### Number Guessing Game

Implement a game where the program generates a random number, and the user has to guess it. Provide hints like "too high" or "too low."

-   Learn: Random number generation, loops, and user input.

##### Temperature Converter

Build a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

-   Learn: Functions, basic math, and user input.

##### Simple HTTP Server

Use the hyper or actix-web crate to create a basic HTTP server that responds with "Hello, World!"

-   Learn: Async programming, web frameworks, and HTTP basics.

### Intermediate Projects

_These projects will help you dive deeper into Rust's features like concurrency, lifetimes, and more advanced libraries._

##### Markdown Parser

Create a program that parses Markdown files and converts them to HTML.

-   Learn: String manipulation, regular expressions, and file handling.

##### Chat Application

Build a simple chat server and client using TCP sockets.

-   Learn: Networking, concurrency (with tokio or async-std), and multi-threading.

##### JSON Parser

Write a program that parses JSON files and outputs the data in a structured format.

-   Learn: Parsing, recursion, and working with enums and structs.

##### Web Scraper

Use the reqwest and scraper crates to scrape data from a website and display it in the terminal.

-   Learn: HTTP requests, HTML parsing, and error handling.

##### Database Wrapper

Create a simple wrapper around a SQLite database using the rusqlite crate. Implement CRUD operations.

-   Learn: Database interactions, structs, and traits.

### Advanced Projects

_These projects will challenge you to use Rust's advanced features and build more complex systems._

##### Compiler for a Custom Language

Build a simple compiler or interpreter for a custom programming language.

-   Learn: Parsing, abstract syntax trees (ASTs), and code generation.

##### Distributed Key-Value Store

Create a distributed key-value store using Rust. Implement replication and fault tolerance.

-   Learn: Networking, concurrency, and distributed systems.

##### Game Engine

Build a simple 2D game engine using the ggez or bevy crate.

-   Learn: Graphics programming, ECS (Entity-Component-System), and game loops.

##### Blockchain Implementation

Implement a basic blockchain with features like mining, transactions, and consensus.

-   Learn: Cryptography, data structures, and networking.

##### Operating System Kernel

Use the x86_64 crate to build a simple operating system kernel.

-   Learn: Low-level programming, memory management, and hardware interaction.

##### Machine Learning Library

Create a small machine learning library for tasks like linear regression or classification.

-   Learn: Linear algebra, traits, and generics.

##### Real-Time Chat with WebSockets

Build a real-time chat application using WebSockets and a web framework like warp or actix-web.

-   Learn: Async programming, WebSockets, and real-time systems.
